//Rhythm is the pattern of sound and silence, the repetition of sounds over time.
//
//Just as visual art creates flow and style through repeated patternsâ€”and brings vibrancy by changing themâ€”music also establishes its flow and character through repetition and gains energy through variation.
//
//Just like art movements are categorized by their patterns, musical styles can also be distinguished by their rhythms.
//
//In Musico, we introduce three of the most exciting rhythm-based music stylesâ€”Hip-Hop, Disco, and Afroâ€”allowing you to experience their unique grooves through vibrations. You can even try recreating these rhythms yourself using the Launchpad!
//
//Close this modal and feel the rhythm!
